User Provider
-store firebase/google auth for users in this file
-reset email/password

Messages Provider
-store firebase message logic in this file

Settings Provider

*What needs to be worked on FIRST?*
1. Setting up firebase, firebase config file***
2. User Authentication(store in user prov file)***
3. Create Registration Page/make it functional***
4. If sign in is successful redirect to home page***

//another idea for future: you can click on the user profile pic to display info/facts about the user (this could be a modal)

// first thing to do: design how I want the page to look then I can visualize where I want things to go***

5. Home Page: Look up home pages for chat apps/target audience: one on one chat with members in the application***
-Allow user to choose another user to send messages to
-Use firebase to send messages in real time and relate messages to user???

-Display all users to the page, make user clickable***
-Logged in user will choose another user, create message to send to user

get messages, have page dynamically view messages

-delete messages and display timestamp
-implement profile pic changers
